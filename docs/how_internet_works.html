            <h1>How The Internet Works</h1>
            <p>
                The internet today consists of multiple different pieces of computer and other devices communicating
                with each other through a network using a wireless and wired network. The Internet is formally defined
                as “a loosely-organized international collaboration of autonomous, interconnected networks, supports
                host-to-host communication through voluntary adherence to open protocols and procedures defined by
                Internet Standards.”
            </p>
            <img src="images/binary.jpg" height="200" width="350" alt="binary"
                 style="float: left; margin:3px 12px 3px;">
            <p>
                The internet speaks in bits and sends binary information in the form of bits. That is the technical
                language of the internet. All information on the internet is made up of bits and sent in bits. Bandwidth
                is the transmission capacity of an internet connection measure by bitrate. Bitrate is the number of bits
                per second a system can transmit and latency is the time it takes for a bit to travel from sender to
                receiver. In order to support data travel at certain speeds, certain equipment is needed since certain
                types of equipment and/or connections might have their limitations.

            </p>
            <p>
                <img src="images/ethernet%20cable.jpg" height="350" width="200" alt="ethernet"
                     style="float: right; margin:3px 12px 3px;">
                Ethernet cables that are powered by electricity may be a good and decent solution given that they are
                cheap and affordable. However, they show measurable signal loss and interference over the distance of
                100ft. So, how can providers supply the internet to distant locations, across oceans for example? One
                answer is light. Light travels faster than electricity through a wire. Bits can be sent as light beams
                through fiber optic cables that are essentially threads of glass engineered to reflect light. However,
                times have shown that fiber optic cables are expensive and difficult to work with. Another answer could
                be a radio signal, however, this method has geographic limitations.
            </p>
            <p>
                When using any wireless connection, this connection is only wireless to a certain extent. Bits are sent
                from
                your device to the router and then are transferred into the physical wire to travel the typical
                distances of
                the internet. Regardless of the technology being used today or the technology that will be used in the
                future, the underlying binary representation of the information and the protocols of sending and
                receiving
                this information have stayed the same. The 1’s and 0’s will always be there.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today there are several types of connections that enable people to connect to the internet. The slowest
                type of internet connection today is the dial-up connection. Dial-up internet uses your phone line, so
                using the internet will prevent you from being able to use your landline and the internet at the same
                time. DSL service also uses the phone line to connect to the internet but does not require a landline at
                home. It also uses a broadband connection which makes it faster than a dial-up connection.

            </p>
            <p>
                Another type of connection would be a cable connection. Cable service connects to the internet via cable
                TV, and also uses a broadband connection to connect to the internet. However, cable connections are only
                available where cable TV is available although it is not required to have cable TV to have a cable
                connection. It is also possible to connect to the internet via satellite. Satellite connection uses
                broadband but does not require a phone or cable line. The connection is established through satellites
                that are orbiting the earth. It can be used almost anywhere in the world, however, the connection can be
                affected by the weather very easily and the speed of satellite connections is usually slower than a DSL
                or cable connection.

            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, we can also connect to the internet using 3G and 4G services. This service is most commonly
                used with mobile phones and tablets when WiFi is not available. It connects wirelessly through your
                Internet Service Provider’s network. These connections are not as stable as DSL or cable connections,
                since speeds can vary depending on network activity, and providers will limit the amount of data you can
                use each month, unlike other connections.

            </p>
            <p>
                <img src="images/switchpanel.jpg" height="200" width="350" alt="ethernet"
                     style="float: left; margin:3px 12px 3px;">
                To be able to establish some of these connections, certain equipment is needed. You may require a modem,
                a router, a switch, or a firewall, and in some cases all four of them. A modem makes the connection to
                the Internet Service Provider. A router will direct the signal to and from multiple computers/devices to
                multiple internet sites. A switch is a device that connects different pieces of a network together.
                Lastly, a firewall is a hardware or software device that filters traffic from the internet to your
                computer to screen for malicious programs, also known as malware. However, the above-mentioned equipment
                is sometimes not enough for certain settings.

            </p>
            <p>
                You may also need cables, NIC, Access Points, and Repeaters. Cables are copper cables or fiber optic
                cables, and they provide a physical means to transport data between devices. A Network Interface Card
                (NIC) is a device to connect a physical cable to a computer usually with an RJ45 connector, also known
                as an Ethernet port. However, if a physical connection is not being established, then you will need an
                Access Point or a Wireless Access Point (WAP). This is a device that allows wireless devices to connect
                to your Local Area Network through WiFi or Bluetooth. Lastly, if your network needs to cover a vast
                area, you will need a Repeater that takes a wireless signal and rebroadcasts it at higher power. This
                will strengthen the signal where there might be a physical impediment and ensure that you have a strong
                connection through and through.
